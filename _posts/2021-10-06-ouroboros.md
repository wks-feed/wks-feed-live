Last time we spoke I was really interested in cycles - or cyclical time which is represented through the snake and spheres etc. Something I’ve been thinking about is how I want the album to sound as if its falling apart… or that its conventions are being mutated at the seams. I have shifted my mind from thinking that there should be an intermission between every track to thinking about how the conventional songwriter record starts to bleed into a string of formless and abstracted ambient passages symbolizing how these previous auditory beginnings are becoming something new and unrecognized. An album that instead of returning - goes somewhere entirely novel as well as nowhere at all. This feels like the breaking of the ouroboros - the dismantling of linear time or expectations.

I wanted to share this all with you in hopes that It can conjure up some inspiration surrounding the design angle of this record. I want to take the rest of this email to sort of give you an idea of what I’ve been thinking about in regards to the package design - maybe some more concrete ideas I have surrounding the albums packaging.

I am going to start back here with the Ryuchi Sakamoto cover design: <http://www.hardformat.org/16/alva-noto-ryuichi-sakamoto-revep-ep/> ideally.. when it is time to scan the actual hard copy of the record it will resemble something similar.. transparency - being able to see through all of the record.

Some materials I found that could help achieve this effect.. or to be able to self assemble it by printing onto these objects. <https://www.aliexpress.com/i/4000086091830.html?spm=2114.12057483.0.0.212c2448QP0DvR>

I purchased a ball python skin that I am looking to somehow incorporate into the records design. I love the colors of the skin and the shapes that you can make with it - specifically half circles or curves. I am trying to imagine a way to ‘print’ this skin onto the albums from in some way.. Or if it had to be more subtle maybe it could be rendered into a line drawing to then be silk screened (?) onto it. I just appreciate the colors which is why im trying to find a way to retain them.
